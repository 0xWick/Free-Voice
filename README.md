### Shadow Network
Smart Contract Code : https://github.com/0xWick/ShadowNetwork-Backend.git

## Title:
A social network for organizations who prioritize anonymity and privacy (hence the name Shadow Network). With everything a secret organization needs from Encrypted file sharing to secret meeting rooms!

## Motivation: 
This project is built on our motivations of making Web3 anonymous and private for people who value their data but still want to interact with each other in a secure and secret way.

## How to use: (Social Media)
Users can create Syndicates, join other syndicates, post in syndicates. Vote & comments on posts.
Syndicate Creators:  (Soulbound NFTs and Push Notifications)
The founder of syndicate choose who can join the network by minting him a "soul-bound NFTs" (he gets notified via Push Protocol's notifications). Then the user can join the syndicate and post, comment, vote in it.

## Syndicate Members (Secure File sharing - Access Control with NFTs):
Also, Syndicate members can share secret data using (lighthouse SDK) Ninja Sharing - Encrypted File, image, text upload and the other party can decrypt and download it.

## Secret Meeting Rooms:
Each Syndicate has a secret Room (shhhh!). But only members can see and meet in that room. Just like Old School Secret Organizations. Using Huddle01 SDK, they can chat, share files, hold live meetings with cam, even record it and save on IPFS.
